## 📖 Overview
Welcome to the GenAI Red Teaming Training repository. This comprehensive, self-paced training curriculum is specifically designed for security researchers. Our focus is on red teaming GenAI and AI/ML systems. 

You'll find hands-on labs, theoretical content, and practical demonstrations of various adversarial techniques. This training goes beyond traditional Responsible AI (RAI) testing by including:

- **Adversarial Attacks**: Learn to create inputs that mislead models or extract sensitive information.
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Identify weaknesses within AI systems that can be exploited.
- **Privacy Breaches**: Understand how to test for data leakage and membership inference.
- **Model Manipulation**: Explore techniques such as poisoning, backdoors, and supply chain attacks.
- **Evasion Techniques**: Discover how to bypass safety measures and content filters.
- **System-Level Exploits**: Learn about prompt injection, jailbreaking, and serialization attacks.

This training equips you with essential offensive security techniques for AI systems.
